Hi, My name is Burhanudin Rabbani. I'm a beginner in web development and currently taking the Bearmentor Bootcamp course. This is Markdown for my personal website, as part of the course assignment. I will develope this Markdown as the course progresses, along with my personal website developer. Thank you.

## Wire Frame

this is a new wireframe. In the future there will be many changes and I hope to always be able to document all the developments on my personal website.

## Final design

This is the first final design. It's still lacking in features and content. Hopefully, I'll consistently share my professional experience on this website in the future. It's also possible that this design won't be 100% identical to the final HTML version.

- logo = home button.
- Project = redirects to the project page.
- About = redirect to my personal learning activity page.
- Contact Me = direct to a page containing a form to fill out so you can connect with me.

Thank God, I managed to make this markdown without exaggerating anything. This is a good start for me to start my career in web development.
