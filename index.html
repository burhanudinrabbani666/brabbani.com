        <p>
          Hi, my name is <strong>Burhanudin Rabbani.</strong> This is my first
          year in web development. Previously, I worked as a manual laborer in a
          factory, specifically in synthetic leather. Working in the factory for
          four years didn't feel challenging to me, although the income was
          relatively stable, but low.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my new career journey by joining and actively participating
          in a course called <strong>Bearmentor</strong>.
          <em>Keep learning and creating </em>is a life motto I hold dear now
          and forever.

          The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports",
          by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on
          May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess
          of victory.[9] Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well
          as Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike
          Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding and Nike CR7.[10] The
          company also sells products under its Air Jordan brand and
          its Converse subsidiary. Nike also owned Bauer Hockey from 1995 to
          2008, and previously owned Cole Haan, Umbro, and Hurley
          International.[11] In addition to manufacturing sportswear and
          equipment, the company operates retail stores under the Niketown name.
          Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the
          world, with the highly recognized trademarks of "Just Do It" and the
          Swoosh logo.
