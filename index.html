        <p>Hi, my name is Burhanudin Rabbani. This is my first year in web development. Previously, I worked as a manual laborer in a factory, specifically in synthetic leather. Working in the factory for four years didn't feel challenging to me, although the income was relatively stable, but low.
        </p>
        <p>I started my new career journey by joining and actively participating in a course called Bearmentor. Keep learning and creating is a life motto I hold dear now and forever.</p>
